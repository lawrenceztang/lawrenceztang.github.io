								<p>My name is Lawrence, and I'm a third year computer science and math student at the University of Chicago. I've lived in Cape Cod, Massachusetts for most of my life, but I've also spent time in Evanston, St. Paul, and Berkeley. I love to program, travel, watch TV, play sports, and much more! I hope to go into software engineering and maybe launch a few startups in the future! More importantly, I want to stay healthy and have caring and supportive friends and family.

								<p>My internship at HPE started with setting up my laptop and watching videos detailing the Kubernetes microservice I was working on. It managed as-a-service software subscriptions. It allowed users to claim subscriptions by entering subscription keys and assigning subscriptions to compatible hardware devices. There was an extraordinary amount of complexity involving the intake of information—from API calls to Hibernate data structures to the SQL databases—as well as the outflow of information to other microservices. Furthermore, I learned about the interactions between numerous microservices and the roles they played in the HPE Greenlake platform. Luckily, my manager and mentor helped me get through the difficult onboarding process by answering the many questions I had. </p>
								<p>After I finally worked through the kinks and became comfortable writing code, I started working on tasks that my manager assigned me. The biggest one was adding support for a new subscription type, HCIaaS. Doing this involved adding new SKUs for the new subscription type and writing logic for its compatible devices. I also worked on writing a new program that detects inconsistencies in the server databases. It does this by running a cron job that runs queries on the SQL databases and logs the output of these queries. There were many other tasks that I completed—I felt like I was able to make a lot of useful contributions to the codebase.</p>
								<p>I had a lot of fun with the interns at HPE. We did activities ranging from Top Golf to laser tag. Some of the interns and I even had a trip to Yosemite. There were also lots of opportunities for free food when there were events or parties. </p>
								<p>My experience at HPE was incredibly eye-opening as it showed me what working in industry as a software engineer is like. </p>

								<p>Sarah, my supervisor at the HRI Lab, kindly referred me to a position at Argonne for the summer after my first year in college. For most of the summer, I worked with Dr. Young Soo Park and PhD student Derek Vasquez on simulating a robot to conduct chemical experiments in a lab. I was once again thrown in the deep end, as the robotics knowledge needed to do this work was far beyond what I acquired at the HRI Lab. Dr. Park first recommended that I read the MoveIt tutorials, but I found that without background knowledge of Gazebo and RViz, I couldn’t get a good grasp of MoveIt. So I had to become familiar with Gazebo, a popular robotics simulation tool, by doing a series of tutorials in which I learned about urdf files that specify the shape of robot, and controllers and transmissions that allow joints to be controlled using ROS.</p>
								<p>Once I became familiar with Gazebo, Derek and I were able to create a urdf model of the robot. We then had to program the robot by coordinating its moving base with its arm to be able to manipulate objects. I found a package to autonomously map and navigate the robot’s MiR 200 base in the simulation using its ultrasound sensors. To control the robot’s arm, Derek got MoveIt set up. However, the gripper proved particularly troublesome. It is difficult to position the robot’s arm in such a precise position that the gripper can grab an object. Moreover, it was hard to get enough grip in the simulation to hold onto an object without it sliding through. Eventually, I decided I had to attach the gripper to the object it was grabbing by <h href="https://github.com/pal-robotics/gazebo_ros_link_attacher">programmatically</h> connecting their links. Now, I could navigate the robot and grab objects with it, but I still had to give the robot the ability to locate objects! I started implementing an object location algorithm using AR tags, but its accuracy was questionable and I never got it to work reliably. However, I was able to program the robot to grab and place an object with a predetermined location. </p>
								<p>The simulation was an important step for our group because we didn’t want to run the physical robot without testing on a simulated one first, as the robot is really powerful and could do some serious damage. I had to focus particularly hard on maintaining good documentation and code style while working on this project so that researchers who had little experience in ROS could use my packages. I also had to communicate well with my supervisor about robotic conventions that I was often previously unaware of, and what he wanted to accomplish. Overall, this was a really tough but rewarding project that I became really dedicated to!</p>

								<video controls preload="none" style="object-fit: contain; width: 100%; height: 100%" poster="images/vector_Moment.jpg"><source src="images/vector.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
								<p> My first formal research experience was in my first year of college at the <a href="https://hri.cs.uchicago.edu/people.html">Human-Robotic Interaction (HRI) Lab</a> at UChicago. I found out about the position from an email on a mailing list that said they were a new lab looking for research assistants to program robots. Because I had some spare time on my hands outside of classes, I emailed the PI of the lab, Sarah Sebo, saying that I was interested in the position and qualified myself by saying I had experience working on computer vision in robots. What I didn’t realize is that robotics is a huge subfield of computer science that makes use of many tools that I did not know yet. </p>
								<p>The first project involved creating a ROS wrapper around an API used to control Anki’s Vector—a cute robot with a little forklift that can move around and a screen to display facial expressions. I had never even heard of ROS before, so I was worried about being able to contribute. Fortunately, I had a coworker, <a href="https://spencerng.me/">Spencer Ng</a>, who seemed to be a ROS veteran (and expert at programming in general). After he, Sarah, and I had our first lab meeting, I took initiative and asked Spencer if we could have a chat. We talked a bit and arranged times where we could call and work on the project together. I was always a step behind what he did, but he helped me learn the foundations of ROS. He also showed me how to document work in a readme using Markdown, and many other important conventions that come with working on a team. He did the brute of the work, but I made sure to check over what he did and made a few commits to the project repository to make Sarah happy. </p>
								<p>Over the rest of the year, I gained confidence in my ROS skills. I was able to work individually on writing a ROS wrapper for the Misty robot by Misty Robotics. When I had trouble accessing Misty’s audio input, I narrowed the problem down to a hardware issue. I contacted Misty Robotics about this, and I had a Zoom call with some of their developers to inspect Misty’s hardware. When the problem was still not fixed, I helped connect Sarah to Misty’s team and arrange to return Misty to get it repaired. I was able to make many contributions to the lab later in the year.</p>
								<p>My work at the HRI lab showed me how important it was to communicate in order to get help. Even though I wasn’t able to contribute to the lab much right away, by communicating with Spencer, I was able to learn from him so I was eventually able to do projects on my own. I also learned that I can grow immensely in just one year. Spencer was only one year ahead of me, but he seemed to be so much more knowledgeable. If a year ago, I saw myself now, I think it’s quite possible that I would’ve been just as amazed. In just the span of one year, I’ve grown so much, making me realize that even when some people seem so much more accomplished or experienced than me, that’s just me in a couple of years as long as I work towards my goals. Finally, maybe the coolest thing about working at the HRI lab was that I got to take Vector to my dorm, where he was quite a sensation with my friends!</p>

								<p>A few years ago, I was really into chess. A friend told me that he made a chess game that let two people play each other in chess, and I decided that I had to one-up him by making a chess engine that searched for an optimal move on top of a playable chess game. To do this, I started out by writing the game rule engine that determines which moves are viable. This was actually very complicated due to rules like en passant, checks, and castling. Then, I wrote the graphics interface using the Java graphics library and made it responsive to clicks from the user. Then, I wrote a minimax search algorithm using the game rule engine to find valid moves and an evaluation function that adds up the values of one player’s pieces and subtracts the values of the opponent’s pieces, giving higher weight to pieces in the center of the board. The engine wasn’t very efficient and could only search around five moves ahead in a reasonable time, but it could beat most of my friends, and it was really cool that it was able to see many good moves that I missed.</p>

								<p>When I attended an Android Development summer course, one of the ideas for an app that my instructor mentioned was a prank texting app that sent fake text notifications to the user. After I got home from the course, the first thing I did was make that exact prank texting app. It took an unexpectedly long time just to make a few app pages because I had to design the whole layout using XML, create event handlers for when the user quits out of the app, and learn how to send notifications. Creating Android apps involves learning many Android-specific things like the activity lifecycle that includes app quitting, startup, and pausing, the View class and all its subclasses which let you display to the screen, and saving app state when it is closed. I had to go through documentation of these concepts that made me confused and gave me headaches, but with enough experimentation, I got the app to work without any major bugs that I know of. I published it in the Google Play store, but I found that getting app downloads is a whole other problem. I don’t really have the marketing arsenal to get users without paying to advertise my app, and very few of my friends have Android phones. When you search up my app in the Play Store, it doesn’t show up! For now, I’ll be content with at least having an app published. </p>

								<p>I’ve recently been really interested in investing, in the stock market in particular. When I started out as an uneducated investor, I constantly heard about people making a career out of day trading, and I secretly aspired to be them because I wanted to be able to make a living by making a few clicks each day. I made the website to find out if you can actually make money by analyzing charts and using intuition to decide when to buy and sell. I also included some automated trading algorithms. To make the website, I had to relearn some skills from a web development course taught by David Malan at the Harvard Summer School that I had long forgotten. Some of these skills included programming the backend with Flask, making a page look good with HTML and CSS, and making buttons do things with JQuery. Programming a fully-fledged website involves bringing many skills together, and it’s not all that easy to do! The advantage of being able to make websites is that now I can create something that I can show off to almost everyone I know, unlike an Android app! </p>

								<p>Available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lawrence.helloar">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
								<p>I had been wanting to make an app that measures distances with a stereo camera for many years, and I finally got around to doing it. I downloaded a bunch of similar apps from the Play Store and found that none of them worked well, so I went ahead with the idea. It turned out that there was already a tutorial by Google that uses the ARCore library that already had most of the functionality I wanted, so I borrowed their code and made a few tweeks. It only took me a few hours to get the app running. I put together a basic app store profile for the app and published it in the Play Store.</p>
								<p>It turns out the difficult part was actually getting downloads. After I had the app published in the Play Store for a while, it had downloads in the single digits. So I used my secret graphic design skills to whip up an app icon, wrote a complete description of the app, and added photos. Since then, it has gotten hundreds of downloads. More recently, I added a video demo of the app and an in-app popup that asks the user to review the app in the Play Store. </p>
								<p>Trying to get downloads for this app was quite a learning experience. Even though my app is pretty trashy, with some effort on the marketing side (even with my basic level of ability) I was able to get a significant number of downloads. I don't want to put that much effort into marketing, so I might have to hire people for this in the future! </p>

								<p>After my friend told me about a freelancing website called Pangaea, I checked it out to look for some programming projects to fill my free time. Some of the positions paid pretty well, so I decided to apply for them. I was politely rejected from the first position I applied for, but to my surprise, I ended up getting the other one I applied for. My boss, Marcelo, gave me some content posted on a bare-bones HTML website and asked me to move it to a WordPress website. Even though I originally sought to gain experience in programming, this project was more art than programming. In fact, I wrote zero lines of code. The experience was a good way to pass time though. I didn't mind sitting there and clicking on a bunch of text boxes and copying text into them and making the colors and images look good. At least I can say that I changed the server the domain name was pointed to, which is kind of technical I guess! Now, I know that I can make WordPress websites pretty easily, which might come in handy now and again.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Athletics</h2>
								<p>I love to play tennis. I didn’t play in high school, but I regained interest in it when my brother and I played almost every day at the start of the COVID pandemic. We played more during winter break that year, and as long as it wasn’t snowing, we would hit in sub-freezing weather. In the summer of 2022 when I was in the Bay for an internship, I continued to play. Luckily, there were more than enough people eager to play in the Bay—I joined a Facebook group for tennis where I found people to play with. It was really interesting meeting all these people, most of whom worked at tech companies.</p>
								<p>I also like to play other sports depending on my current desire and what my friends like to do. Some of these activities include rock climbing, ice skating, and squash. I love to stay active. </p>

								<p>I love to travel. I think this has to do with my curiosity. I love to experience new cultures, landscapes, climates, plants, and animals. Some of my favorite places I have visited include Seattle, Shanghai, and Dakar. </p>
								<p>I am studying abroad in Dakar, Senegal, as of the winter of 2022-2023. My experiences in Dakar have shown me a world that is completely different from the US, which intrigues me. They have taught me to appreciate different cultures. However, I have seen how western society is shaping Dakar, and I hope increased globalization won't take away from the uniqueness of the culture here.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Photography</h2>
								<p>I started doing photography over the summer, when my dad got me a DSLR camera for my birthday. As I started learning about photography, I realized there was much more complexity and nuance to it than I had previously thought, which sparked my interest, as I enjoy solving problems with many dimensions of complexity. In photography, these dimensions include the angle, zoom, distance from the subject (which affects the photo differently than zoom), f-stop, ISO, and lighting. I enjoy playing with these different parameters to find an appealing photo. Sometimes, there is a trade-off between these parameters, which I find interesting—for example, if you change the angle, sometimes the lighting isn’t as ideal.</p>
